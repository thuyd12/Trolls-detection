# Trolls detection
On social networks, it is important to be able to identify individuals who behave badly towards the community. The problem is reliable classification: predicting for each account if it conforms to the rules of the community or not.

For example, Shapr, a professional networking platform, found that a small number of users were registering on its platform but exhibited a pattern of inappropriate behaviour that contradicted the purpose of the platform.

In this exercise, we will use real data from Shapr. You will have access to:

 the result of a manual validation describing whether the account is problematic or not (this is the "variable to explain").
 as well as the corpus of data describing new accounts (what is the length of the text typed in the bio, what are the other social networks, what is the name of the email provider, ...): these are the explanatory variables.
